    "Pausanias’ ”Description of Greece”, the travelogue presenting details on ancient\n",
    "Greece’s cultural and geographic features, showcases a dominance of masculine\n",
    "and male figures and an absence of feminine characters. Pausanias’ work also\n",
    "focuses on Greece’s cities and sacred places reflecting religious beliefs and rituals.\n",
    "Such features were all supported by the result of textual analysis in terms\n",
    "of types, lemmas, lemmata, and lexemes.\n",
    "Pausanias’ work relies on a heavy indication of mythological figures, the majority\n",
    "of them being male characters. Aligning with the predominance of ”his” and\n",

    "was also featured in the lemma analysis, with AF 355, 302 and RF 1302, 1108.\n",
    "The gendered nature of ancient Greece is well-reflected by Pausanias’ narrative\n",

    "The aforementioned conclusion of males being the center of narrations is also\n",
    "supported by the lack of female-related tokens. The lower frequency of ”her”\n",
    "with AF 539 and RF 1978 suggests that ancient Greece had little focus on female\n",
    "characters. Though certain female gods, such as Athena, were mentioned\n",
    "at a higher frequency(AF: 320, RF: 1174) than some male gods (Heracles), the\n",

    "Besides the findings that suggest the gendered political and social environment,\n",
    "the heavy presence of ancient Greek religious beliefs is indicated by data analysis\n",
    "of Pausanias’ Description of Greece. The high frequency of ”sanctuary”\n",
    "(AF: 605, RF: 2220) clearly shows ancient Greeks’ religious worship of gods.\n",
    "This conclusion is also supported by the heavy presence of ancient Greek gods\n",
    "such as Zeus, Heracles, and Athena.\n",
    "Additionally, as a travel guide, Description of Greece focuses on cities, infrastructures,\n",
    "and their sacred institutions. This finding aligns with the frequent\n",
    "appearance of ”city” (AF: 530, RF: 1963), and ”temple” (AF: 449, RF: 1663).\n",
    "Within the general focus of city life, Pausanias could also have focused on social\n",
    "relationship between people and classes, as indicated by the word ”against”\n",
    "(AF: 435, RF: 1611). Political campaigns could be a potential topic Pausanias\n",
